This set of scripts is for fixing the UUIDs of locations that were created on installation machines. The UUIDs need
to be changed to match the UUIDs of the locations created on the metadata server.

The mfl_map.dat file was created by executing the following query on the metadata server with batch output mode:

SELECT la.value_reference, l.name, l.uuid FROM location l
INNER JOIN location_attribute la ON la.location_id = l.location_id
INNER JOIN location_attribute_type lat ON lat.location_attribute_type_id = la.attribute_type_id
  AND lat.uuid = '8a845a89-6aa5-4111-81d3-0af31c45c002';"

To make the fix...

1. Run check_duplicates.sh - this script shows any locations with duplicated MFL codes. If you find any duplicates
you will need to delete locations or fix their MFL codes.

2. Run check_codes.sh - this script shows any locations with unrecognised MFL codes. The only
location that should be listed here is the 'Unknown Location' (id = 1). If there are other locations then you will
need to update their MFL codes.

3. Run fix_uuids.sh - this script will update UUIDs of all locations by looking up their MFL code in the mfl_map.dat
